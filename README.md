# Mini-Snake-Game
The game is kind of like the Snake Game, but the "snake" is a square and only moves when you press a button, where it only moves from 1 square to another. The fruit's locations aren't randomized (cuz idk how to do that in Processing) so there are 5 fruits in locations I chose, and whenever the player is above a fruit it disappears.
First scuffed hobby-made game.
